                    <h2>You can fight your ticket in court and win!</h2>
                    <p>Although, in the 6<sup>th</sup> ward, only 10% of tickets get contested, those which do
                        win their in court cases 65% of the time.</p>

                    <h3>Important Deadlines</h3>
                    <!-- TODO maybe we can make this like a story/timeline? -->
                    <p>For a parking or compliance violation, you have 7 days from the date your ticket was
                        issued to contest it. If a contest or payment has not been made by then, you will be
                        given another 21 days to request a hearing.</p>
                    <p>For traffic law violations caught by an automated camera (red light or speeding
                        violations) you are given 21 days from the Notice of Violation to contest the ticket before a
                        Notice of Determination will be mailed to you detailing that you have been found liable.</p>
                    <p>However, you still have the option to petition to stop the default judgement by appearing in person
                        within 21 days after you have received the Notice of Determination.
                        After this you can no longer contest the ticket.</p>
                    <p>After 25 days of the Notice of Determination you will be mailed a Notice of Final
                        Determination detailing that you can no longer contest the ticket and a penalty equal to
                        the amount of the fine will be given.</p>


                    <h3>How to win your case in court</h3>
                    <p>For parking or compliance violations, including the most common violations in the 6th
                        ward (no city sticker, no standing/parking, street cleaning, expired plates, missing plates), the
                        following defenses could be used:</p>

                    <!-- TODO remove legalese but otherwise good -->
                    <!-- TODO link to original legal definitions? -->
                    <ul>
                        <li>You were not the owner of or were not leasing the vehicle at the time the ticket was issued</li>
                        <li>The vehicle or its plates were stolen when the ticket was issued</li>
                        <li>The signs prohibiting or restricting parking were missing or were too difficult to see</li>
                        <li>The parking meter was not functional and not because of anything you did</li>
                        <li>The alleged violations are not consistent with what was brought up during the
                            time the ticket was issued. Some examples include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>You may contest a city sticker violation if you
                                    have resided in Chicago for less than 30 days or you purchased the cited vehicle
                                    in the last 30 days</li>
                                <li>Tinted windows can be a required medical accessory when
                                    complying with 5 ILCS 5/12-503(g)</li>
                                <li>The residential parking ticket was issued to a delivery, service, or repair vehicle
                                    or home health care provider doing business with or assisting a resident of the zone</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The illegal condition cited did not exist at the time the ticket was issued</li>
                        <li>The compliance violation has been corrected prior to the judge making a ruling;
                            however, you must ensure you are not applicable to other compliance violations
                            at this time</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Handling Debt</h2>
                    <p>Even if it's too late to go to court, if you're struggling with ticket debt, there are options.</p>
                    <h3>Appeals Process</h3>
                    <p>If you have an unmanagable amount of debt with the City of Chicago due to unfair pressure
                        caused by receiving too many tickets, you can still appeal you violations in order to
                        substantially reduce the amount owed and improve your wellbeing.</p>
                    <h3>Declaring Bankruptcy</h3>
                    <p>If your vehicle has been impounded as a result of late penalties on debt owed declaring
                        bankruptcy is a path to resolution that allows you to regain possession of your vehicle.</p>
