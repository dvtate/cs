			<h3>Packing</h3>
			<img src="./img/packers-by-van.jpg" alt="packers with boxes" />
			<p>Did you know that most damage to items in boxes occurs because the box is under-packed or too heavy? Packing for long moves can be difficult, and many companies don't accept items packed by the owner. For interstate moves, trust our team of trained moving experts to carefully pack and preserve your items. We supply the boxes and staff, and we'll even unpack your dishes and other fragile items on site in your new home. Packing services cost less than you think, and you will have peace of mind that your goods will arrive in one piece.</p>

			<p>Our trained movers and drivers take the utmost care in securing your household items during transit. Our drivers wrap and carefully load furniture, and we have one of the lowest claims rates in Illinois. Delicate items like heirloom furniture and bulky items like pianos are no problem: our drivers have seen it all. On average, our drivers have 12 years' experience moving household goods. Rest assured, your items are in safe hands.</p>
