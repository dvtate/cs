The Dinner Party  - S5E13

With improvements to technology since the time Seinfeld is set in, many of the struggles encountered in the episod could be eliminated or mitigated. Some technologies which the characters could have utilized include google maps, uber/lyft, credit/debit cards, etc. With these in mind, we can rewrite the plot as follows.

Jerry & Elane check the weather on their phone and realize it's going to be very cold. They begin discussing what they should wear in preparation for the weather when George barges in wearing his new gortex coat. Elane points out that they should bring a party gift. After searching online for what is socially acceptable they agree they should bring a bottle of wine and a cake. Using google maps, they find a bakery with good ratings and a liquor store to go to and plan a route. They place their order in online to the bakery and pay with a card. When they get to the bakery they get to pass the benedicts because they pre-ordered. They see the baker coughing and decide to check the cake, finding a hair on it. They complain and ask for a new cake. While waiting, they submit a 2 start yelp review of the bakery explaining their experience. They then proceed to the the liquor store to purchase a bottle of wine. After the clerk doesn't want to change George's $100, george uses his credit card. Upon exiting the liquor store they realized they have been double-parked. They call an uber to pick them up and take them to the dinner party.
